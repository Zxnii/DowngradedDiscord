# DowngradedDiscord

This is a simple patched version of Discord, there really isn't a lot to it.

### Development

Install all dependencies via `npm install`, make any desired changes and then patch discord via `npm run inject`

For PTB and Canary you can do `npm run inject -- -ptb` and `npm run inject -- -canary` respectively.

### Todo

* Plugins
* Open-source
* Don't expose require
